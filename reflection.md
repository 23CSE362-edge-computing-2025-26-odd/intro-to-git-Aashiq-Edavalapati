# Reflection: Revisiting Git & GitHub Basics

## What I already knew
Before starting this assignment, I was already familiar with:
- Creating and cloning repositories
- Committing and pushing changes
- Working with branches and resolving merge conflicts
- Creating pull requests and reviewing code

## What this assignment helped me reinforce
Even though I already use GitHub, this was a helpful refresher on:
- The overall GitHub flow (especially for collaborative development)
- Importance of writing meaningful commit messages
- Using markdown effectively to create clean and readable documentation
- Best practices for managing repositories and user profiles

## What I'm planning to do next
- Improve my GitHub profile README to showcase my skills and projects
- Start working on more collaborative open-source or team-based projects
- Explore advanced Git features like submodules and GitHub Actions
- Build a habit of using issues and project boards to manage my personal projects

## Final thoughts
This assignment reminded me how powerful Git and GitHub are—not just for code versioning, but also for collaboration, project planning, and personal branding. I’m excited to apply these skills to real-world projects and hackathons.


I personally love github!
